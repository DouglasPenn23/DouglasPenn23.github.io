              I'm from a small town in Ohio, known as Oak Harbor. Upon graduating I attended the University of Toledo, where I received my Bachelor's 
              degree & proudly managed the Women's Basketball team throughout successful, winning seasons. From there I attended WeCanCodeIt, a 
              trade school through the State of Ohio and received a certificate of Software Development. Upon completion, I began my career in Knoxville,
              Tennessee at AttentionIT. There I wrote software for nuclear laboratories and chemical processing & transportation facilities. I am now an
              Independent Contractor with a wide variety of skills to offer the software world. In my free time, I enjoy basketball, hiking, kayaking, TV
              & Film, playing bass guitar and studying history.
